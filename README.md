# K_Nearest_Neighbour

The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple, easy-to-implement supervised machine learning
algorithm that can be used to solve both classification and regression problems. However, it is more widely
used in classification problems in the industry.<br>
K-NN algorithm assumes the similarity between the new case/data and available cases and put the new case
into the category that is most similar to the available categories.This means when new data appears then it can
be easily classified into a well suite category by using K- NN algorithm.<br>
K-NN is a non-parametric algorithm, which means it does not make any assumption on underlying data. It is
also called a lazy learner algorithm because it does not learn from the training set immediately instead it
stores the dataset and at the time of classification, it performs an action on the dataset i.e it classifies that data
into a category that is much similar to the new data.
